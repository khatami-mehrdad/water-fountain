# Sustainable 4'×4' Yard Water Fountain (Berkeley)

This repo contains **three complete fountain concepts** sized for a **36"×36" square basin** inside a **4'×4'** yard area. Each concept is:

- **Wildlife-safe** (birds + beneficial insects) with **no toxic chemicals**
- **Low-maintenance** with a practical filtration plan
- Designed for **pleasant multi-stage water sound**
- Intended for **corded AC power** (simple + reliable)

## The three concepts (for community voting)

### 1) Basalt Column + Slate Spill Arms (2–3 drops)

## Quick comparison (36"×36" basin)

| Concept | Sound stages | Sound character | Build difficulty | Maintenance | Est. cost (DIY) | Best feature |
|---|---:|---|---|---|---:|---|
| **Basalt + slate arms** | 2–3 | layered pours, multi-pitch | Medium | Low–Medium | $300–$650 | Most premium look + best layered sound |
| **Basalt + two bowls** | 3 | “musical” splash, tunable | Medium | Medium | $280–$600 | Crisp splash sound + bird-friendly bowls |
| **Bamboo 2-stage** | 2 | classic pour, calming | Easy–Medium | Low | $200–$450 | Highest feasibility + simplest plumbing |

## Build stages (applies to all three)

Each concept doc includes an end-to-end staged plan:

- **Stage 0**: choose sound + scale targets (drops, heights, vibe)
- **Stage 1**: source materials (basin/stone/pump/filters/electrical)
- **Stage 2**: bench test pump + dry-fit plumbing (bucket test)
- **Stage 3**: prep the site (level/compact/drainage)
- **Stage 4**: place + level the basin
- **Stage 5**: install pump vault + tubing/valves
- **Stage 6**: assemble the visible feature (arms/bowls/spouts)
- **Stage 7**: conceal hardware + fill
- **Stage 8**: tune sound + splash control; mark valve settings
- **Stage 9**: commission water quality (rinse filter after 24–48h)
- **Stage 10**: ongoing maintenance

## Shared water-quality approach (all concepts)

- **Mechanical filtration (must-have)**: pump pre-filter sponge + “pump vault” (crate) hidden under river rock.
- **Optional (only if you get leaves/debris)**: inline screen/canister filter on the pump outlet.
- **Algae management (wildlife-safe)**:
  - keep water moving
  - keep water shallow (2.5"–3.5")
  - partial water refresh during hot months
  - optional barley straw extract (no copper/bleach/algaecides)

## Community voting prompts

When choosing the winner, consider:

- **Sound**: do we prefer layered pours (slate arms), musical splashes (bowls), or calm pour (bamboo)?
- **Maintenance**: are we okay wiping bowls more often for the best splash sound?
- **Look**: darker “basalt zen” vs warmer “bamboo wabi-sabi.”
- **Complexity**: do we want the simplest build (bamboo) or the most premium presence (slate arms)?

## What happens next

After community voting, we’ll build the winning concept using the selected materials (basin, stone, pump/filters), then keep a simple maintenance log (what worked, what to adjust for sound/clarity).
