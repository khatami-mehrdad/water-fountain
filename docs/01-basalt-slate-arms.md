## Summary (what you’re building)

A **36"×36" freestanding square basin** filled with smooth river rock and shallow water. A **central basalt column** rises from the basin. Water is pumped to the top and routed to **2 or 3 slate “spill arms”** at staggered heights. Each arm creates a distinct **water drop** into the basin for a layered sound.

---

## Target dimensions (scaled to a 4'×4' area)

- **Overall pad available:** 48"×48"
- **Basin outer size:** **36"×36"**
- **Breathing room:** ~6" border around basin (gravel/planting/maintenance access)
- **Basin wall height:** ~8" (typical for stone/GFRC basins)
- **Water depth:** **2.5"–3.5"** (bird-friendly, lower splash risk)
- **Basalt column:** **20"–24" tall**, ~8"–10" wide (visual anchor without feeling oversized)

### Sound tuning targets (drops)
Aim for staggered drop heights to create different pitches:
- **High arm:** 10"–12" above water surface (louder, higher pitch)
- **Mid arm:** 6"–8"
- **Low arm:** 3"–5" (soft “close-to-water” texture)

---

## Build feasibility

- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Time:** 1 weekend (prep + assemble + tune)
- **Key skills:** leveling, hiding plumbing neatly, basic stone placement

This concept is very feasible DIY because it’s fundamentally:
1) a square basin, 2) a pump + tubing, 3) a stable central stone, 4) a few controlled spill points.

---

## Build stages (start → finish)

### Stage 0 — Decide the “sound + scale” targets (30–45 min)
- Choose **2-drop** or **3-drop** configuration.
- Choose drop heights (recommended):
  - High: 10"–12", Mid: 6"–8", Low: 3"–5"
- Decide sound goal:
  - **More sound**: slightly higher drops + a bit more flow
  - **Less splash**: keep drops shorter and closer to water

### Stage 1 — Source materials (shopping run)
- Basin (36"×36"), basalt column, 2–3 slate arms, river rock.
- Pump (400–660 GPH), 1/2" tubing, manifold/tees, **mini valves per arm**, pre-filter sponge, pump vault.
- Electrical: GFCI outlet access + outdoor-rated cord as needed.

### Stage 2 — Bench test & pre-assemble (1–2 hours)
- In a bucket/tub, run the pump and confirm:
  - flow rate is sufficient at your estimated height
  - noise level is acceptable
- Dry-fit your manifold and label the arm valves (High/Mid/Low).

### Stage 3 — Site prep (1–2 hours)
- Level + compact the 4'×4' pad.
- Confirm drainage (DG/gravel is good—avoid standing puddles).

### Stage 4 — Place and level basin (30–60 min)
- Set basin centered, level it carefully (critical for consistent spill sound).

### Stage 5 — Install pump vault + plumbing (1–2 hours)
- Place pump vault where it can be accessed (a removable “service corner”).
- Route the main line up behind/through the column location.
- Install manifold + valves.

### Stage 6 — Set column + mount arms (2–4 hours)
- Stabilize the basalt column on a flat base stone.
- Set slate arms at heights that create distinct drops.
- Ensure spill streams land **inward** (minimize splash-out).

### Stage 7 — Hide hardware + fill (1 hour)
- Place river rock to conceal vault and tubing.
- Fill to 2.5"–3.5" depth.

### Stage 8 — Tune sound + mark settings (30–90 min)
- Tune each arm’s valve:
  - balance the three sound pitches
  - reduce any splash-out
- Mark your “good” valve positions so you can restore them after cleaning.

### Stage 9 — Commission water quality (same day)
- Rinse the pre-filter sponge after 24–48 hours (new installs shed grit).
- Optional: add barley straw extract (per label) if you want slower algae growth.

### Stage 10 — Ongoing maintenance (simple routine)
Follow the maintenance plan below (weekly top-off + filter rinse every 2–3 weeks).

---

## Day-by-day timeline (recommended)

### Day 1 (setup + assemble)
- Site prep + level basin.
- Install pump vault + plumbing manifold + valves.
- Set basalt column and mount arms (dry-fit first).
- Add river rock, fill, and do first-pass sound tuning.

### Day 2 (tuning + commissioning)
- Fine-tune each arm’s valve for balanced sound and minimal splash.
- Mark valve positions (photo + paint pen mark).
- Rinse pre-filter after 24–48 hours (new installs shed grit).

---

## Tools checklist

- 2'–4' level (or digital level)
- Hand tamper (for DG/gravel)
- Shovel + rake
- Bucket/tub (bench test)
- Utility knife + hose clamps
- Adjustable wrench / pliers
- Rubber mallet (stone positioning)
- Work gloves + eye protection
- Optional: shop-vac (cleaning grit), shims (leveling arms)

## Materials (Bill of Materials + cost ranges)

### Visible materials (the “nice looking” part)
- **36"×36" square basin** (stone, GFRC concrete, or heavy-duty basin with a stone surround): **$150–$500**
- **Basalt column** (drilled or drillable): **$60–$200**
- **Slate spill arms (2–3 pieces)**: **$20–$80**
- **River rock** (smooth, dark/neutral mix to hide hardware): **$25–$70**

### Hidden functional materials

## Filtration & water quality (wildlife-safe)

### Mechanical filtration (do this)
1) Put the pump inside a **pump vault** (crate) to keep it accessible.  
2) Wrap the pump intake with a **pre-filter sponge** to catch debris.  
3) Hide the vault with **river rock** (do not fully bury it in fine gravel).

### Optional “clear water” upgrade (only if needed)
Add a small **inline screen/canister filter** between pump outlet and manifold if your yard drops leaf litter into the basin.

### Algae control (safe, realistic)
You’ll never get “zero algae outdoors,” but you can keep it at a **light wipeable film**:
- keep water moving (already built-in)
- keep the basin partially shaded when possible
- do a partial refresh during hot months
- optional: barley straw extract (avoid copper/bleach/algaecides)

---

## Wildlife safety

- Keep **shallow water** (2.5"–3.5") and include at least one **flat “landing rock”** that breaks the surface.
- Avoid chemical algaecides (especially copper-based). Use only mechanical filtration + safe practices above.
- Keep spill areas non-slip (natural stone is ideal).

---

## Electrical & safety

- Use a **GFCI-protected** outdoor outlet.
- Create a **drip loop** on the cord before it reaches the outlet.
- Keep all connections dry and off the ground (use an outdoor cord cover if needed).
- Use a pump rated for continuous operation and outdoor use.

---

## Step-by-step build (high-level)

### 1) Prepare the base
- Rake and level the 4'×4' area.
- Compact the base (hand tamper).
- Add/refresh **decomposed granite (DG)** or fine gravel and re-level.

### 2) Place the basin
- Set the 36"×36" basin centered with ~6" around.
- Confirm it’s level in both directions (important for even spill sound).

### 3) Install the pump vault + plumbing
- Place the pump vault in a corner of the basin (easy access).
- Run 1/2" tubing from pump up through/behind the basalt column.
- Add a **manifold** to split flow to each spill arm.
- Add a mini valve per arm.

### 4) Set the basalt column
The column must be stable:
- set it directly on a flat stone base inside the basin, or
- pin it to a hidden base plate (heavier-duty, optional)

### 5) Mount the slate spill arms
Two practical approaches:
- **Stone shelf + hidden tubing outlet** (cleanest look)
- **Small spill lip insert** under slate to control sheet flow (best sound consistency)

### 6) Add river rock + fill + tune
- Add river rock to hide hardware and soften splashes.
- Fill with water to 2.5"–3.5".
- Start pump and tune each arm using the mini valves:
  - aim all flows inward (avoid splash-out)
  - adjust drop heights if needed for your desired volume

---

## Maintenance plan (easy + sustainable)

### Weekly (5 minutes)
- Top off water (evaporation).
- Quick check: flow even? any splash-out?

### Every 2–3 weeks (10–20 minutes)
- Rinse the pump pre-filter sponge.
- Wipe the spill lips/arms if biofilm appears.

### Seasonally
- Drain and rinse basin (optional but nice).
- Inspect tubing/valves for clogs.

---

## Risks & mitigations

- **Splash loss / wet surrounding gravel**
  - keep drops shorter
  - aim pours inward
  - keep water depth at least ~3"
- **Uneven spill (one side louder)**
  - re-level basin
  - add small shims under slate arms
  - tune flow with the per-arm valves
- **Clogged spill points**
  - pre-filter sponge solves most of it
  - optional inline screen if you have leaf litter

- Strong visual impact in a small footprint
- Multi-stage sound with distinct pitches
- Clean “architectural zen” vibe that doesn’t look cheap
- Filtration and maintenance are straightforward and scalable
