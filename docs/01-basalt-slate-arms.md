# Concept 1 — Basalt Column + Slate Spill Arms (2–3 drops)

**Best for:** premium look + layered, multi-pitch sound with manageable maintenance.

## Summary (what you’re building)

A **36"×36" freestanding square basin** filled with smooth river rock and shallow water. A **central basalt column** rises from the basin. Water is pumped to the top and routed to **2 or 3 slate “spill arms”** at staggered heights. Each arm creates a distinct **water drop** into the basin for a layered sound.

---

## Target dimensions (scaled to a 4'×4' area)

- **Overall pad available:** 48"×48"
- **Basin outer size:** **36"×36"**
- **Breathing room:** ~6" border around basin (gravel/planting/maintenance access)
- **Basin wall height:** ~8" (typical for stone/GFRC basins)
- **Water depth:** **2.5"–3.5"** (bird-friendly, lower splash risk)
- **Basalt column:** **20"–24" tall**, ~8"–10" wide (visual anchor without feeling oversized)

### Sound tuning targets (drops)
Aim for staggered drop heights to create different pitches:
- **High arm:** 10"–12" above water surface (louder, higher pitch)
- **Mid arm:** 6"–8"
- **Low arm:** 3"–5" (soft “close-to-water” texture)

---

## Build feasibility

- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Time:** 1 weekend (prep + assemble + tune)
- **Key skills:** leveling, hiding plumbing neatly, basic stone placement

This concept is very feasible DIY because it’s fundamentally:
1) a square basin, 2) a pump + tubing, 3) a stable central stone, 4) a few controlled spill points.

## Materials (Bill of Materials + cost ranges)

### Visible materials (the “nice looking” part)
- **36"×36" square basin** (stone, GFRC concrete, or heavy-duty basin with a stone surround): **$150–$500**
- **Basalt column** (drilled or drillable): **$60–$200**
- **Slate spill arms (2–3 pieces)**: **$20–$80**
- **River rock** (smooth, dark/neutral mix to hide hardware): **$25–$70**

### Hidden functional materials
- **Submersible pump (AC)**: **400–660 GPH**: **$25–$60**
- **1/2" tubing** (kink-free recommended): **$10–$25**
- **Manifold/tees** + **2–3 mini ball valves** (one per arm for tuning): **$15–$40**
- **Pump pre-filter sponge**: **$5–$12**
- **Pump vault** (plastic crate or pump vault box): **$10–$40**
- **Check valve (optional)** (helps keep prime / reduces backflow noise): **$8–$18**
- **Outdoor-rated extension cord** (if needed) + cable management: **$20–$60**

### Estimated total cost (DIY)
- **Low:** $300–$400 (budget basin + local stone finds)
- **Typical:** $420–$550
- **High:** $550–$650+ (premium stone basin + larger basalt)

## Filtration & water quality (wildlife-safe)

### Mechanical filtration (do this)
1) Put the pump inside a **pump vault** (crate) to keep it accessible.  
2) Wrap the pump intake with a **pre-filter sponge** to catch debris.  
3) Hide the vault with **river rock** (do not fully bury it in fine gravel).

### Optional “clear water” upgrade (only if needed)
Add a small **inline screen/canister filter** between pump outlet and manifold if your yard drops leaf litter into the basin.

### Algae control (safe, realistic)
You’ll never get “zero algae outdoors,” but you can keep it at a **light wipeable film**:
- keep water moving (already built-in)
- keep the basin partially shaded when possible
- do a partial refresh during hot months
- optional: barley straw extract (avoid copper/bleach/algaecides)

---

## Wildlife safety

- Keep **shallow water** (2.5"–3.5") and include at least one **flat “landing rock”** that breaks the surface.
- Avoid chemical algaecides (especially copper-based). Use only mechanical filtration + safe practices above.
- Keep spill areas non-slip (natural stone is ideal).

---

## Electrical & safety

- Use a **GFCI-protected** outdoor outlet.
- Create a **drip loop** on the cord before it reaches the outlet.
- Keep all connections dry and off the ground (use an outdoor cord cover if needed).
- Use a pump rated for continuous operation and outdoor use.

---

## Step-by-step build (high-level)

### 1) Prepare the base
- Rake and level the 4'×4' area.
- Compact the base (hand tamper).
- Add/refresh **decomposed granite (DG)** or fine gravel and re-level.

### 2) Place the basin
- Set the 36"×36" basin centered with ~6" around.
- Confirm it’s level in both directions (important for even spill sound).

### 3) Install the pump vault + plumbing
- Place the pump vault in a corner of the basin (easy access).
- Run 1/2" tubing from pump up through/behind the basalt column.
- Add a **manifold** to split flow to each spill arm.
- Add a mini valve per arm.

### 4) Set the basalt column
The column must be stable:
- set it directly on a flat stone base inside the basin, or
- pin it to a hidden base plate (heavier-duty, optional)

### 5) Mount the slate spill arms
Two practical approaches:
- **Stone shelf + hidden tubing outlet** (cleanest look)
- **Small spill lip insert** under slate to control sheet flow (best sound consistency)

### 6) Add river rock + fill + tune
- Add river rock to hide hardware and soften splashes.
- Fill with water to 2.5"–3.5".
- Start pump and tune each arm using the mini valves:
  - aim all flows inward (avoid splash-out)
  - adjust drop heights if needed for your desired volume

---

## Maintenance plan (easy + sustainable)

### Weekly (5 minutes)
- Top off water (evaporation).
- Quick check: flow even? any splash-out?

### Every 2–3 weeks (10–20 minutes)
- Rinse the pump pre-filter sponge.
- Wipe the spill lips/arms if biofilm appears.

### Seasonally
- Drain and rinse basin (optional but nice).
- Inspect tubing/valves for clogs.

---

## Risks & mitigations

- **Splash loss / wet surrounding gravel**
  - keep drops shorter
  - aim pours inward
  - keep water depth at least ~3"
- **Uneven spill (one side louder)**
  - re-level basin
  - add small shims under slate arms
  - tune flow with the per-arm valves
- **Clogged spill points**
  - pre-filter sponge solves most of it
  - optional inline screen if you have leaf litter

## Why this concept is a top candidate

- Strong visual impact in a small footprint
- Multi-stage sound with distinct pitches
- Clean “architectural zen” vibe that doesn’t look cheap
- Filtration and maintenance are straightforward and scalable
