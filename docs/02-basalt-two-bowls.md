# Concept 2 — Basalt Column + Two Bowls (3-stage splash)

**Best for:** the most “musical” splash sound with a compact, premium feel.  
**Reference image:** `liked/basalt-column_two-bowls_3stage.png`

---

## Summary (what you’re building)

A **36"×36" freestanding square basin** with shallow water and river rock. A short basalt column feeds an **upper stone bowl**, which overflows into a **lower stone bowl**, which overflows into the basin. This creates **three distinct sound stages** with crisp, pleasant splashes.

---

## Target dimensions (scaled to a 4'×4' area)

- **Basin outer size:** **36"×36"**
- **Basin wall height:** ~8"
- **Water depth:** **2.5"–3.5"**
- **Basalt column:** **18"–22" tall**
- **Upper bowl:** ~8"–12" diameter, lip height ~14"–16"
- **Lower bowl:** ~12"–14" diameter, lip height ~8"–10"

### Sound tuning targets
This concept is all about controlled splashes:
- **Stage 1:** column → upper bowl (small drop, crisp)
- **Stage 2:** upper bowl → lower bowl (medium drop, “rounder” tone)
- **Stage 3:** lower bowl → basin (largest drop, deepest tone)

---

## Build feasibility

- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Time:** 1 weekend
- **Key skills:** stable bowl mounting + aligning overflows to avoid splash-out

This is very feasible DIY because plumbing can be simple (one feed line up; gravity does the rest). The main care point is **bowl stability** and **aim**.

## Materials (Bill of Materials + cost ranges)

### Visible materials
- **36"×36" square basin**: **$150–$500**
- **Basalt column**: **$60–$180**
- **Two stone bowls** (granite/basalt/river stone): **$80–$240** (pair varies a lot)
- **River rock**: **$25–$70**

### Hidden functional materials
- **Submersible pump (AC)**: **400–600 GPH**: **$25–$60**
- **1/2" tubing**: **$10–$25**
- **Ball valve** (to tune flow): **$8–$15**
- **Pump pre-filter sponge**: **$5–$12**
- **Pump vault** (crate): **$10–$40**
- **Check valve (optional)**: **$8–$18**
- **Outdoor-rated extension cord** (if needed): **$20–$60**

### Estimated total cost (DIY)
- **Low:** $280–$360 (budget basin + affordable bowls)
- **Typical:** $380–$520
- **High:** $520–$600+ (premium basin/bowls)

## Filtration & water quality (wildlife-safe)

### Mechanical filtration (do this)
Same proven setup:
- Pump inside a **vault**
- Pump intake wrapped with a **pre-filter sponge**
- River rock hides the vault but keeps access easy

### “Bowls are debris catchers”
The bowls look great but naturally collect:
- dust/pollen
- leaf bits
- biofilm/mineral spots

That’s not a deal-breaker—just plan on **quick wipe/rinse** more often than Concept 1.

### Algae control (safe)
Same approach:
- movement + shallow water
- occasional partial refresh in hot months
- optional barley straw extract

---

## Wildlife safety

- Keep water shallow (2.5"–3.5") and add a **flat standing stone** in the basin.
- Bowls are naturally bird-friendly, but keep surfaces stable and avoid deep “trap” shapes.
- Avoid chemical algaecides; use mechanical filtration + safe practices above.

---

## Electrical & safety

- Use a **GFCI-protected** outlet.
- Add a **drip loop** before the cord reaches the outlet.
- Keep connections dry/off-ground; use outdoor-rated cords and covers if needed.

---

## Step-by-step build (high-level)

### 1) Prepare base + place basin
- Level/compact DG or gravel.
- Place basin and level carefully (important for predictable overflows).

### 2) Pump vault + feed line
- Put the pump vault in a basin corner.
- Run tubing to the top outlet point (near column top).
- Add a single ball valve for flow tuning.

### 3) Set column + bowls (stability first)
The critical success factor is a stable “stack”:
- Set column on a flat base stone.
- Set bowls on sturdy stone pedestals or hidden supports.
- Ensure each overflow lands **inside** the next bowl (not on the rim).

### 4) Add rock concealment + fill + tune
- Add river rocks to hide supports and soften splashes.
- Fill to 2.5"–3.5".
- Tune flow:
  - too loud/splashy: reduce flow or reduce drop heights
  - too quiet: slightly increase flow or raise upper bowl a bit

---

## Maintenance plan

### Weekly (5 minutes)
- Top off water.
- Quick wipe of bowl lips if you see film.

### Every 2–3 weeks (10–20 minutes)
- Rinse the pre-filter sponge.
- Rinse bowls if debris accumulates.

### Seasonally
- Drain/rinse basin (optional).
- Inspect tubing for buildup.

---

## Risks & mitigations

- **Splash-out from bowl overflows**
  - keep bowl lips close to the next landing surface
  - adjust aim so overflow falls inward
  - reduce pump flow slightly
- **Uneven overflow**
  - shim bowls to level
  - keep basin level
- **Mineral spots (Berkeley water can leave marks)**
  - wipe periodically
  - optional: use a simple dechlorinator / let water sit before filling (cosmetic)

## Why this concept is a top candidate

- Strong multi-stage sound (most “musical”)
- Visually rich without needing a tall structure
- Great for birds (shallow, approachable water surfaces)
- Simple plumbing and easy tuning
