# Concept 3 — Bamboo Double-Spout + Catch Basin (2-stage pour)

**Best for:** highest feasibility + classic Japanese garden feel with calming pour sound.  
**Reference image:** `liked/bamboo_double-spout_2stage.png`

---

## Summary (what you’re building)

A **36"×36" freestanding square basin** with shallow water. A simple cedar/redwood post holds **two bamboo spouts** at different heights. Water pours from the upper spout into a **small catch basin**, then pours again (via a notch or second spout) into the **main basin**. This gives a clean **two-stage sound** and a timeless look.

---

## Target dimensions (scaled to a 4'×4' area)

- **Basin outer size:** **36"×36"**
- **Basin wall height:** ~8"
- **Water depth:** **2.5"–3.5"**
- **Post height:** ~24"–30" above basin rim (keeps it elegant, not towering)
- **Upper spout drop:** ~10"–14" into the catch basin (audible pour)
- **Catch basin size:** ~10"–14" square/round (stone), sitting ~6"–10" above main water surface
- **Lower spout drop:** ~6"–10" into the main basin

---

## Build feasibility

- **Difficulty:** Easy–Medium
- **Time:** 1 day + tuning
- **Key skills:** simple carpentry + basic plumbing

This concept is the most straightforward because:
- there are fewer stone alignment constraints
- one water line up, gravity does the rest

## Materials (Bill of Materials + cost ranges)

### Visible materials
- **36"×36" square basin**: **$150–$500**
- **Cedar/redwood post** (or hardwood): **$15–$60**
- **Bamboo spouts (2)**: **$10–$50**
- **Catch basin (stone)**: **$40–$150**
- **Accent rocks / river rock**: **$25–$70**

### Hidden functional materials
- **Submersible pump (AC)**: **250–500 GPH**: **$20–$55**
- **1/2" tubing**: **$10–$25**
- **Ball valve** (flow tuning): **$8–$15**
- **Pump pre-filter sponge**: **$5–$12**
- **Pump vault** (crate): **$10–$40**
- **Inline screen/canister (optional)**: **$20–$60**
- **Outdoor-rated extension cord** (if needed): **$20–$60**

### Estimated total cost (DIY)
- **Low:** $200–$280
- **Typical:** $280–$380
- **High:** $380–$450+ (premium basin + nicer stone catch basin)

## Filtration & water quality (wildlife-safe)

### Mechanical filtration
This design is very friendly to filtration because the plumbing is simple and accessible:

- Put the pump inside a **pump vault** (crate) so it’s easy to pull out.
- Wrap the pump intake with a **pre-filter sponge** to catch debris.
- Hide the vault with **river rock** (leave a “service corner” you can lift).

### Optional “clear water” upgrade
If you get a lot of leaf litter or want extra clarity, add a small **inline screen/canister** filter on the pump outlet before the tubing goes up the post.

### Algae control (safe, realistic)
- Keep water moving (built-in).
- Keep water shallow (2.5"–3.5").
- Partial refresh during hot months.
- Optional barley straw extract (avoid copper/bleach/algaecides).

---

## Wildlife safety

- Keep shallow water (2.5"–3.5") and include at least one **flat landing rock**.
- Avoid chemical algaecides; use mechanical filtration + safe practices above.
- Keep the pour aimed inward so birds don’t have to land on slick edges.

---

## Electrical & safety

- Use a **GFCI-protected** outlet.
- Add a **drip loop** before the cord reaches the outlet.
- Keep connections dry/off-ground; outdoor-rated cord/covers if needed.

---

## Step-by-step build (high-level)

### 1) Prepare base + place basin
- Level/compact decomposed granite (DG) or fine gravel.
- Place the 36"×36" basin and level it carefully.

### 2) Build the post + spout assembly
- Use cedar/redwood (outdoor friendly).
- Route the tubing up the back of the post (hide it).
- Mount two bamboo spouts at different heights:
  - upper spout pours into the catch basin
  - lower spout (or notch) pours into the main basin

### 3) Install pump vault + run tubing
- Place pump vault in a basin corner.
- Add a ball valve to tune flow (quieter vs louder pour).
- Run tubing up to the upper spout.

### 4) Place the catch basin and set the “second stage”
- Elevate the catch basin on a stable stone block inside the main basin (or on a hidden support).
- Ensure the catch basin overflow lands cleanly in the main basin (aim inward).

### 5) Add river rock + fill + tune
- Add river rock to hide the vault and supports.
- Fill to 2.5"–3.5" depth.
- Start the pump and tune flow:
  - louder: slightly higher drop + a bit more flow
  - quieter: lower drop + reduce flow

---

## Maintenance plan

### Weekly (5 minutes)
- Top off water.
- Quick wipe of spout lip and catch basin edge if you see film.

### Every 2–3 weeks (10–20 minutes)
- Rinse the pump pre-filter sponge.
- Rinse catch basin if debris collects.

### Seasonally
- Inspect bamboo for cracks/splitting; replace if needed.
- Drain/rinse basin (optional).

---

## Risks & mitigations

- **Bamboo weathers over time**
  - plan to replace bamboo every 1–3 years, or use an outdoor-rated bamboo-look spout
- **Spout clogs / uneven stream**
  - pre-filter sponge prevents most clogs
  - inline screen filter if you have leaf litter
- **Splash-out**
  - keep drops modest
  - aim pours inward
  - keep water depth ~3"

## Why this concept is a top candidate

- Simplest build path with high probability of success
- Classic Japanese aesthetic, calming and intentional
- Easy to tune the pour sound without complex stone work
- Great filtration compatibility (easy to keep water clear)
